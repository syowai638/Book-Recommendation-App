# Bots Project
- Bots Project allows users to interact with a collection of bots. Users can view all available bots, add them to their army, and manage their bot collection. The interface provides functionality to enlist bots to your army, release them when needed, and even discharge them permanently from the backend.

## Features
-Bot Profiles: View a list of all available bots rendered in the BotCollection.

-Enlist Bots: Add a bot to your army by clicking on it. Each bot can only be enlisted once.

-Manage Your Army: The bots you enlist appear in the YourBotArmy component, and they remain in the BotCollection until you choose to release them.

-Manage Your Army: The bots you enlist appear in the YourBotArmy component, and they remain in the BotCollection until you choose to release them.

-Discharge Bots: Permanently delete a bot from both the backend and your army by clicking the red "x" button.
